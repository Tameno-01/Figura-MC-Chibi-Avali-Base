# You don't need to shade this avatar yourself!

Simply do the following

1. Recolor the avatar **without changing any UVs**
1. Open the texture you created in blockbench in your image editing software of choice
1. Download [this image](/images/shading.png)
1. Add it as a new layer, on top of the recolored texture
1. Export the image
1. Set it as the texture in blockbench

If you wand an unshaded texture to start with, you can get it [here](/images/albedo.png).
